# frontend-pagebuilder-demo

This is just a running demo of the silverstripe frontend builder.

Just

- git clone git@github.com:adiwidjaja/frontend-pagebuilder-demo.git
- composer install

This assumes the existence of \_ss_environment.php with a defined database connection (and default admin).

It installs a site with simple-theme. Search for a frontend login button in the lower left of your browser. When logged in the FPB-Buttons appear (sorry, German at the moment).
